      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <div class="span7">
        <img class="img-intro" src="assets/img/aboutme.jpg" align="left" />
        <h2>Short &amp; Sweet</h2>
        <p class="text-tab">My name is Nicky Thomson. I am currently attending the University of Waterloo and I am taking my fourth year in the Software Engineering program. I love coding, reading sci-fi and playing video games. "Niktorious" happens to be one of many names I've used for gaming in the past.
        </p>
        <p class="text-tab">That's me in the picture, of course, taking a break after a day of fun in the sun. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqNcsdPyKzs">You can watch what I was up to that day.</a> When I'm not messing around on my computer, I do my best to get out skiing and, more recently, rock climbing.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h2>Programming &amp; Work</h2>
        <p class="text-tab">I started programming when I was in grade 10. It was then that I first was introduced to Turing, a simple language used to teach new coders. I loved it, making little games and not worrying about anything behind the scenes. Near the end of high school I picked up C, and I knew what I wanted to do in university. <a href="http://github.com/nikt">Check out my github if you want to see what I've been up to recently.</a>
        </p>
        <p class="text-tab">I started Software Engineering at uWaterloo in 2009. Since the program is a co-op program, the degree that normally takes four years would now take me five. I knew this going in and, even now, I have no regrets about choosing it. The experience I've gathered throughout my work terms is much more valuable to me than getting out of school one year earlier. <a href="resume.html">Feel free to check out my resumé.</a>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="span7">
        <img class="img-intro" src="assets/img/skis.jpg" align="left" />
        <h2>Still here?</h2>
        <p class="text-tab">I've been skiing for as long as I can remember. While I grew up in Ottawa, my parents signed me, my brother, and my sister up for ski lessons every winter. Eventually we joined the race team, and ever since then I've loved the thrill of speed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-tab">As soon as I was old enough I took the Level 1 Coach and Level 1 Instructor certification courses offered by <a href="http://www.canskicoach.org/">CSCF</a> and <a href="http://www.snowpro.com/">CSIA</a> respectively. I got a job teaching some of the younger groups in the racing program at the ski hill while I was in high school.

        <h2>Guilty Pleasures</h2>
        <p class="text-tab">I find that video games are a great escape from boredom. I love all kinds of video games, old and new, but recently a couple favourites have been DotA 2, Diablo 3, and LIMBO. My all-time favourites would probably include Dark Souls, Tales of Symphonia, Halo (all of them, but I haven't played Halo 4 yet, so no spoilers!) and Smash Brothers. Of course, the handheld Pokemon games will always hold a special place in my heart as well.
        </p>
        <p class="text-tab">Video game design fascinates me, especially the similarities that persist between all genres and the vast range of successful ideas. I enjoy the challenge presented by a tough puzzle, I enjoy the test of fast-paced action titles, and I enjoy the immersion of a detailed RPG. I've always been drawn to video games and I believe that is what drives my enthusiasm for programming.
