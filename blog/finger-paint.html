        <h1>Finger Paint</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="span8">
        <h2>A Learning Project</h2>
        <p class="text-tab">I created <a href="https://github.com/nikt/Finger-Paint">this simple Android app</a> a long time ago in an attempt to teach myself about Android development. It is a very naive implementation of a finger painting application. It is possible to pick paint colours, stroke widths, and background canvases. Aside from solid colours, the user can also choose a picture on the phone to use as the background instead. There are quite a few things that I learned about, including a number of things I learned <i>not</i> to do.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="span8">
        <h2>The Basics</h2>
        <p class="text-tab">Looking back on my old code now, it's cringe-worthy looking at some of the things that I wrote. I'll go over some the things that I would change a little later. First I want to talk about the drawing method that I used.
        </p>
        <p class="text-tab">The way that the app paints is quite simple. When the user touches the screen, the app records a <code>Point</code>. When the user moves a finger along the screen, the app records the new point (a <code>FriendlyPoint</code> in this case), and connects it to the previous point. Fairly straightforward.
        </p>
        <p class="text-tab">The <code>Point</code> class looks something like this:</p>
        <pre class="lang-java prettyprint">
public class Point {
  public final float x, y;
  public final int col;
  public final int width;
  
  public Point(final float x, final float y, final int col, final int width) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.col = col;
    this.width = width;
  }
  
  public void draw(final Canvas canvas, final Paint paint) {
    paint.setColor(col);
    canvas.drawCircle(x, y, width/2, paint);
  }
}</pre>
      <p class="text-tab">And the <code>FriendlyPoint</code> class looks something like this:</p>
      <pre class="lang-java prettyprint">
public class FriendlyPoint extends Point {
  private final Point neighbour;
  
  public FriendlyPoint(final float x, final float y, final int col, final Point neighbour, final int width) {
    super(x, y, col, width);
    this.neighbour = neighbour;
  }
  
  @Override
  public void draw(final Canvas canvas, final Paint paint) {
    paint.setColor(col);
    paint.setStrokeWidth(width);
    canvas.drawLine(x, y, neighbour.x, neighbour.y, paint);
    canvas.drawCircle(x, y, width/2, paint);
  }
}</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="span8">
        <p class="text-tab">When I had originally written the drawing code, I just drew a line between to joined points. When the user selected a width greater than 1px, the image would end up drawing two lines that didn't quite match up. The result was never very pleasing.
        </p>
        <img class="img-mid" src="../assets/img/finger_paint_1.png"/>
        <p class="text-tab">The current implementation paints lines much more smoothly. By drawing a circle (with diameter equal to the width of the line) at each of the 'hinges', the kinks are eliminated.
        </p>
        <img class="img-mid" src="../assets/img/finger_paint_2.png"/>
        <p class="text-tab">I have always been interested in graphics and I'm even taking a class on the topic during my upcoming university term. Looking forward to it!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="span8">
        <h2>What Not To Do</h2>
        <p class="text-tab">I don't plan on going back and fixing anything in this app because I think it shows what I've learned since then. However, I would like to comment on what is wrong in the code.
        </p>
        <p class="text-tab">The entire list of points redraws every time a new point is added. This is very inefficient and the effects of this decision can definitely be felt as the app slows down when more points are drawn. A better choice would be to just draw the newest point and only redraw everything if something large happens that would affect the existing points, like changing the background.
        </p>
        <p class="text-tab">I also don't really like how I implemented the options system. The menu is only shown when the user clicks on the hardware menu button that Android phones have. I think it would have been worth the screen real estate that the menu would take up to make the feature more discoverable.
        </p>
        <p class="text-tab">Once again, all of the code can be found on my <a href="http://github.com/nikt">github</a> if you feel like checking the rest of it out.
