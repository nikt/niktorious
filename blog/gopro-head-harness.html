      <h1>DIY: GoPro Head Harness</h1>

      <div class="span9">
        <img class="img-intro" src="../assets/img/aboutme.jpg" align="left" />
        <h2>A Brave New Purchase</h2>
        <p class="text-tab">I recently bought myself a <a href="http://gopro.com/">GoPro</a> camera. I picked up the </a href="http://gopro.com/cameras/hd-hero3-white-edition">HERO3 White Edition</a> and I've had a ton of fun playing with it. It came with two mounts: a flat mount and a curved mount. I stuck the curved mount on my ski helmet but unfortunately the ski season ended before I got a chance to try it out on the slopes. I still have the flat mount but I haven't thought of anything which could use it yet.
        </p>
        <p class="text-tab">However, I did want to use the camera and I didn't want to wait until the next ski season to do that. So I began looking into how other people have used their own GoPro cameras. In the end I decided that I really wanted to try it out while bouldering.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="span9">
        <img class="img-intro" src="../assets/img/gopro_headstrap.jpg" align="left" height="324" width="244"/>
        <h2>Small Budget, Big Plans</h2>
        <p class="text-tab">I started off by looking into head harnesses because it would be highly impractical, not to mention ridiculous in appearance, to wear my ski helmet while bouldering. It turns out that GoPro does sell a <a href="http://gopro.com/camera-mounts/head-strap-mount">head strap mount</a> but at $20 (CA) it was out of my price range. And yes, I do realize that this is very cheap compared to the overall cost of the camera, but I'm on a student budget.
        </p>
        <p class="text-tab">At this point I decided to try making my own. How much would it cost? How long would it take? How hard could it be?
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="span9">
        <img class="img-intro" src="../assets/img/hat1_small.jpg" align="left" height="324" width="244"/>
        <h2>A Lightbulb Moment</h2>
        <p class="text-tab">It's safe to say that winter overstayed its welcome this year. Fortunately for me, this lead to an interesting discovery. I have a fairly large collection of toques and even though I love them, I was looking forward to packing them up for the year. As I stared outside at yet another day of snowfall, I was playing with a toque in my hands when I realized that it may be the answer to my camera problems.
        </p>
        <p class="text-tab">Since toques are almost always double layered, they can hold something small (read: camera-sized) comfortably inside. So soon I was scouring stores for a cheap toque, and eventually found one that I liked for $10.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="span9">
        <img class="img-intro" src="../assets/img/hat3_small.jpg" align="left" height="324" width="244"/>
        <h2>Uncharted Territory</h2>
        <p class="text-tab">To start off, I needed a way to load the camera into the hat. I cut a slit into the back of the hat approximately the length of the camera. Since the material of the hat is quite stretchy, the camera can be inserted easily.
        </p>
        <p class="text-tab">In the picture I put a piece of paper inside the hat so the cut can be easily seen. When you wear the hat, the cut is pretty much invisible to the casual observer.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="span9">
        <img class="img-intro" src="../assets/img/hat4_small.jpg" align="left" height="324" width="244"/>
        <h2>In Focus</h2>
        <p class="text-tab">Next I cut a small cross into the front of the toque. This is where the lens of the camera will rest. Before I made this cut, I slid the camera through the rear and positioned it inside where it would sit when I wore the hat. Putting on the hat with the camera inside helps to judge how it will feel and to be honest, it doesn't feel that different from a regular toque. With the camera inside, mark where the lens sits. Remember to take the camera out before cutting!
        </p>
        <p class="text-tab">Once again I made the cut slightly smaller than the camera because it will stretch to fit. The snug fit also helps to hold the camera in position once it's inside.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="span9">
        <img class="img-intro" src="../assets/img/hat5_small.png" align="left" height="324" width="244"/>
        <h2>Final Product</h2>
        <p class="text-tab">I'm quite satisfied with how it turned out in the end. The buttons are all easy to access while inside the hat. The most important thing to note about this design is that I am not using the protective case around the GoPro. This is a fairly big drawback for any sport where the robustness of the GoPro is necessary (like skiing).
        </p>
        <p class="text-tab">Sometimes the material of the hat can get in the way of the lens which is annoying and you can't really tell if you are actually wearing it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="span9">
        <img class="img-intro" src="../assets/img/hat6_small.png" align="left" height="324" width="244"/>
        <p class="text-tab">In this profile shot, you can see another adjustment I made to the design after trying it out. I've taped the edges of the slit I made in the back to prevent it from fraying due to stretching. If I were to repeat this experiment, I would look into hemming the edges. Hemming the cuts would also help keep the hat out of the way of the lens.
        </p>
        <p class="text-tab">The harness that GoPro makes lets you use the protective case and adjust the angle of the camera. I believe that it was designed to be worn over top of a hat or helmet. This harness has the advantages of being cheap and can be customized to your style.
